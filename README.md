# odin-recipes

Small project made for the Odin Project foundations course. It is just a simple web page that, with the help of the information available on allrecipes.com, shows you the recipes for three of my favorite Peruvian dishes.

In the making of the project, I learned and demonstrated my abilities to make simple web pages using headers, lists, images, and links. I also learned how to use Git and GitHub for coding projects.
